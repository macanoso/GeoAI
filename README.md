**GeoAI: Segmentation of Vegetation Encroachment in Powerlines using UAVs and Deep Learning**

This project focuses on the development of a deep learning model for the segmentation of vegetation encroachment in natural environments using drone-acquired data. The project includes the collection of a large dataset of drone images of natural environments, manually labeled for vegetation encroachment, as well as extensive data preprocessing and transformation. The model was trained using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, and the results were evaluated using various metrics to assess the model's performance. The project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of using deep learning and drone data for environmental analysis and management.

## **Introduction**  <a name="Introduction"></a>
Vegetation encroachment is a critical environmental issue that can have significant impacts on natural ecosystems and human activities. Identifying and monitoring vegetation encroachment in natural environments is essential for effective management and conservation efforts. In recent years, the increasing availability of drone-acquired data and advancements in deep learning techniques have opened up new opportunities for automated vegetation mapping and analysis.

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for the segmentation of vegetation encroachment in natural environments using drone-acquired data. The project includes the collection of a large dataset of drone images of natural environments, manually labeled for vegetation encroachment, as well as extensive data preprocessing and transformation. The model was trained using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, and the results were evaluated using various metrics to assess the model's performance.

The project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of using deep learning and drone data for environmental analysis and management, and to provide a useful tool for identifying and monitoring vegetation encroachment in natural environments. The project also has implications for other applications, such as forestry, agriculture, and land use planning, where accurate and timely information on vegetation cover is critical for decision-making.
